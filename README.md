# Baldi Scripts
Here are the extracted C# Scripts that are in Baldi's Basics `Assembly-CSharp.dll` file.

Used [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases/tag/v6.1.8) to extract the files. All scripts come from the `-` namespace. Feel free to use 'em lol.

Note that every Script is from Baldi's Basics `1.4.3` Vanilla
